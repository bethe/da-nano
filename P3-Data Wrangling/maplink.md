## Maplinks
- I downloaded the dataset for Dublin Ireland from MapZen:  
https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/dublin_ireland.osm.bz2.

- This corresponds to the City of Dublin on Open Street Map:

## Justification
I picked this area as I've been living there for 6 years and am familiar with cultural backgrounds and local address formats. Living there also made it the most interesting for me to explore.
