I downloaded the dataset for Dublin Ireland from MapZen at https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/dublin_ireland.osm.bz2.

This corresponds to the City of Dublin on Open Street Map: http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3473474851

I picked this area as I've been living there for 6 years and am familiar with local data formats.
